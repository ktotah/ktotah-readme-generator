  ## Installation 
  To use the README Generator, you must have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have Node.js installed, download and install it before continuing. After installing Node.js, follow these steps: 1. Clone the repository to your local machine; 2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal; 3. Install the necessary dependencies by running: `npm install inquirer@8.2.4` in your terminal; 4. Confirm you are now set up with Inquirer version 8.2.4 by running the command: `npm list inquirer` to see the installed version of Inquirer within your project. If it returns `inquirer@8.2.4`, then the installation process is complete.

  ## Usage 
  To use the README Generator, follow these steps: 1. Open your command-line terminal; 2. Navigate to the directory where your project is located; 3. Run the command `node index.js`; 4. Answer the prompts as they appear in your terminal. Each prompt will guide you through entering the necessary information for your README, such as project title, description, installation instructions, and so on.
